# Tic Tac Toe Network Game

## Introduction
This Tic Tac Toe project is a Java-based implementation of the classic game, enhanced with network capabilities allowing two players to play against each other over a local network. The game uses a client-server architecture where the server handles the game logic and client connections, and the client provides a graphical user interface for player interaction.

## Features
- **Network Play:** Play against another player across a network.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Easy to use interface built with Swing.
- **Dynamic Connection Handling:** Server can handle multiple clients, assigning them as players in the game.
- **Real-time Updates:** Game state is updated across clients in real-time as players make their moves.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Network access between the client and server machines
